TO DO LIST
 - when asking for the output file, add the .root extension automatically if it is not defined - DONE
 - should I make the tree function and column transpose function seperate? - DONE
 - tree function should abort if the input file path is not eligible - DONE
 - make a list of errors and call the errors when needed instead of writing them one by one in each function?
 - it has to check whether the input file is COMPLETELY eligible! 
 - the output.root files should be saved to a special file (make it tidy)
