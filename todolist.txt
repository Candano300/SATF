TO DO LIST
 - when asking for the output file, add the .root extension automatically if it is not defined / DONE
 - should I make the tree function and column transpose function seperate? / DONE
 - tree function should abort if the input file path is not eligible / DONE
 - make a list of errors and call the errors when needed instead of writing them one by one in each function? // gereksiz
 - it has to check whether the input file is COMPLETELY eligible, i.e. if it is a true data file or 
    the wrong file. The code aborts if it is not a true data file. 
 - the output.root files should be saved to a special file (make it tidy) / DONE
    - create the "outputs" directory within the program if it does not exist. / DONE
- maybe the interface should ask the path of the datafile as default, then give you the list of commands // DONE // UNDONE NOW , UNNECESSARY 
    since all the commands require the path first? Therefore: 
    - make the output "transpose" vector a private variable within the class. /nope 
    - add a reset function to the interface if the user wants to add another file  /no interface anymore
- maybe make it so that it can store the past files paths and the user does not have to work with pasting the path again
- open every file in a given directory and create root trees of them
- link TTree to TChain
- use TTrees as an input for graph function
- based on the name of the input, plot graphs together
